## Chapter 1

In this first video, I've created a Flask project, I've added the necessary
dependencies and structured the folders.

For this, I've used the Poetry to create the project and add the dependencies.
Then, I've created some simple endpoints to test my application.

To structure the endpoints, I've also used the Blueprints.
